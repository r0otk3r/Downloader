## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

-    The platform selector is optional  yt-dlp detects platform automatically from the URL.

-    You can later add format selectors (e.g., MP3, 720p) or platform-specific logic (e.g., TikTok login).

-    This uses Flask's development server ‚Äî for production, use Gunicorn or uWSGI.

## Production Usage

Install Gunicorn:
```bash
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```
